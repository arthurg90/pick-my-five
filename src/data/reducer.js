/*s
In order to generate Teams, there need to be some additional functions carried out to make changes to the State
1. get the "players" list from state, if there are 10 players in the array
2. apply randomisation logic to it so that the players are shuffled and assign the array to a new variable
3. push this new array into the "teams" state - the function needs to return the new teams array
4. teamA will take the first 5 players from this updated teams array
5. teamB will take the last 5 players from the updated teams array



Logic for shuffling players:
const shufflePlayers = ({players}) = {
let currentIndex = players.length,
  while (0 !== currentIndex) {
    randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * currentIndex);
    currentIndex -= 1;
    temporaryValue = players[currentIndex];
    players[currentIndex] = players[randomIndex];
    players[randomIndex] = temporaryValue;
    }
    return players;
  };

  let result = shuffle(playersCopy);
  return state.update({teams: result});
};
